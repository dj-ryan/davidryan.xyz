# Summary
This is an audio exciter project. I am utilizing a large polystyrene panel as the resonating surface for sound production. The exciter itself, a small cylindrical device, is securely attached to the back of the panel. The exciter is powered by a battery-operated Bluetooth amplifier, which is neatly integrated into the project's design. The panel is suspended within a wooden frame, constructed with screws and brackets, allowing for unimpeded vibration and optimal sound generation.
