## Overview
I had the desire to build a computer during the ending years of high school and at the beginning of college but never had the money or resources to justify the cost and time. Finally, at the beginning of the summer of 2020, I felt like I was in a position to pursue this desire. I then began to design the type of system that I wanted.

Building an end-all be-all system with high-end, maxed-out components wouldn't make a lot of sense. First, I wouldn't need this type of processing power, and second because in a few short years all of those components would be outdated.

### Tuesday June 30, 2020
#### FINISHED THE BUILD!
The build took about 4 hours from parts to Windows. The two biggest problems were that I forgot to power the GPU during the first post and also overheating the CPU during Windows install. I wanted to make sure the system would post so after installing the GPU, RAM, CPU, and storage I attempted a boot. The graphics card wasn't powering on, and I soon realized this was because I wasn't giving it power from the power supply. After getting graphical output, I attempted to install Windows. At this point, I did not have the CPU cooler installed; however, I did not think this was going to be a problem. I was completely wrong. Installing an OS is a very CPU-intensive process, and the CPU would overheat not very far into the install. I only realized this was my problem by accidentally touching the CPU (and burning myself). After that, I installed the CPU cooler, and the rest of the process was relatively smooth. Cable management was fairly clean. The case provided several conveniently placed ports with rubber flaps to feed cables through. The only complaint that I have is there was not a direct route for the cables to take on the back side of the motherboard around the hard drive bays and into the PSU area. However, after it was all said and done, my inner OCD was very pleased. I tuned all of the RGB to a white output which really pulled the build together and gave it that clean look that I was after. An unintentional byproduct was the reflection of RAM's white LEDs from the metal backing on the GPU. It actually splits the spectrum into RGB which looks pretty cool. I am extremely happy with the final product!
