# Drone Drop
**The Legendary Drone Drop**

Below was the first version my brother and I made.

A cardboard box was attached to the belly of a knock off drone. An Arduino mega controlled a small servo that actuated the bottom flap of the card board box. The Arduino was triggered by an IR sensor mounted on the bottom of the box. 

Press the button and the parachute man fell free! In theory.
