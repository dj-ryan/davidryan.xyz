# Burnit ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

*A simple CPU stress tester written in c++*
## Compilation and execution
On windows the command prompt script can be used to compile and execute the programed with the default settings.

After that, the executable can be run with different settings using the flags listed below.

If on a unix platform you can use the shell script to do the same.

If you are compiling yourself it must be compiled with `-std=c++17`

## Algorithm
The algorithm that is implemented to produce a heavy load on the CPU is the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes). This very simple algorithm calculates (or rather finds) all prime numbers up to a pre-determined limit. This is done by - "iteratively marking as composite (i.e., not prime) the multiples of each prime, starting with the first prime number, 2. The multiples of a given prime are generated as a sequence of numbers starting from that prime, with constant difference between them that is equal to that prime." ~ Wikipedia
## Flags
```

[-t,--threads threads] [-s,--seconds seconds] [-l,--limit limit] [-k,-keepgoing] [-h]

```

- `-t,--threads threads`
    - Allows you to adjust the number of threads used which in turn adjusts the number of CPU cores
    - The default value is determined by the system core count (including multi-core systems)
- `-s,--seconds seconds`
    - Allows you to adjust the number of seconds the stress tester is run
    - The default value is 5 seconds
- `-l,--limit limit`
    - Allow you to adjust the upper limit when searching for primes
    - The default value is 10'000'000
- `-k,-keepgoing`
    - Overrides the default seconds value and allows for infinite execution time
    - The default value is false
