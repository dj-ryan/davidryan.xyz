# Tri-Source Power Supply
![DC-DC Converter](/dc-dc-converter.png)

This project was made possible by three high-quality DC to DC converters that I obtained from my internship over the summer of 2020 at Virtual Incision. These DIN rail mounted converters are from Bel Power (Model: [LDD240-WU](https://www.belfuse.com/product/part-details?partn=LDD240-WU)) and provide DC to DC conversion with an output of 5-55VDC based on an input of 10A and 12-48VDC. Each power supply has several safety overcurrent and under voltage protections that make each model a self-contained high-performing DC to DC converter. I received three of these models.

## TIMELINE

### Sunday August 2, 2020
#### Finished build
The final purchase was the remaining two AC to DC converters. I purchased the exact same model as the first one (24V 10A). I then finished the assembly, which consisted of mounting the AC to DC converters using the velcro straps, wiring the outputs to the inputs of the DC to DC converters, and wiring the power outlets to the inputs of the AC to DC converters. Mounting the power strip at this point was a challenge. It would have been better to plan ahead for this. I ended up unscrewing a screw on two of the AC to DC converters and replacing it with a longer one and a bolt so that it protruded from the side (but was still attached due to the bolt). I then used the mounting sockets on the power strip to slip it onto these protruding screws. The mount was stable enough and extended the side of the power supply a manageable amount.

#### Velcro straps and single power cable
I finally purchased some 18in velcro straps. These work perfectly to hold down the AC to DC converters. The only problem being if a nail is slightly slanted (which there are a few), the velcro strap has a tendency to slip to the edge. This isn't a major problem because the head of the nail will usually catch it. Another design flaw is that each AC to DC converter needs its own 120-volt power supply, meaning I would need three outlets to run the device at full capacity. To solve this problem, I purchased a 3 source power strip with an on and off switch as well as normal 120-volt plug breakouts so that I can wire them directly.

### Tuesday June 30, 2020
#### Added AC to DC converter support
I purchased a single 24V 10A AC to DC converter to figure out how I was going to mount it. I will eventually need three. I added a third support that extends off the base. There are three nails that are inserted perpendicularly into each side of the support for a total of 6. These nails will support velcro straps that will strap the AC to DC converters down.

### Friday June 12, 2020
#### Constructed Frame
I purchased an aluminum 12in DIN rail to mount all three of the voltage converters on. I designed a simple mounting frame out of 2x4. There are two posts that stand vertically on a base to make a U-shaped frame. The DIN rail is mounted on the back side of the frame so that the voltage converters can rest on the inside of the U shape.
